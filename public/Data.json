In this course, I realized programming is powerful, also, it makes our lives more convenient. So I applied what I had learned to make a visual novel in another class, which was built with Processing and JavaScript, and this project was well-received by external assessors, and our team won second place.\nThe experience above inspired me to be an engineer, so I started to learn front-end development, I was not only learned it from school, but also from books and technical documents on the Internet. To make use of what I had learned, I applied for an internship in my third summer vacation, learning how to use React.js and developing a data service system with backend engineers. In my senior year, I was an intern in another company, helping them maintain the e-commerce platform, besides, I built a map for the Singaporeans to pick up with Vue.js. Besides, I took courses such as data structure and algorithm to improve my ability.",
